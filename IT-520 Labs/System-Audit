## Section 1: System Inventory

| Component | Specification |
|-----------|---------------|
| Operating System | [e.g., Windows 11 Pro, Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, macOS Sonoma 14.x] |
| Total Installed RAM | [e.g., 16 GB] |
| CPU Model & Clock Speed | [e.g., Intel Core i7-10750H @ 2.60 GHz] |

## Section 2: The Access Control Model

### Model Definition
My operating system ([OS Name]) uses **[DAC/MAC/RBAC]** (Define the acronym) as its primary Access Control Model.

**Definition:** [Provide a concise definition of the model. Example: "Discretionary Access Control (DAC) is a model where the owner of a resource has full control over who can access that resource and what permissions they have."]

### Relationship to Permissions
[Explain how this model relates to Read/Write/Execute permissions. Example: "In DAC, the file owner can assign R/W/X permissions to specific users or groups, allowing granular control over who can read, modify, or execute files."]

### Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) Application
[Explain how administrators/users apply this model to enforce PoLP on your OS.]

**Concrete Example:**
[Provide a specific example from your OS. Examples:
- Windows: "An administrator creates a service account for a backup application and restricts its permissions to only Read access on the C:\Data folder, preventing it from modifying system files."
- Linux: "Using chmod, a user sets permissions on a sensitive script to 700, ensuring only the owner can read, write, or execute it."
- macOS: "In System Preferences, an admin restricts a standard user account from installing applications, limiting potential malware installation."]

## Section 3: Top Process Analysis & Risk

### Process 1: [Process Name]
- **Process Name:** [e.g., chrome.exe]
- **Process ID (PID):** [e.g., 5432]
- **Resource Consumption:** [e.g., CPU: 25% or RAM: 1.2 GB]

**Security Risk Hypothesis:**
[Describe a specific security risk if this process were exploited. Example: "If Chrome were compromised through a browser exploit, an attacker could access saved passwords, cookies, and browsing history, leading to credential theft and session hijacking."]

### Process 2: [Process Name]
- **Process Name:** [e.g., mysqld]
- **Process ID (PID):** [e.g., 2048]
- **Resource Consumption:** [e.g., RAM: 2.5 GB]

**Security Risk Hypothesis:**
[Example: "If the MySQL daemon were exploited via SQL injection or privilege escalation, an attacker could access, modify, or delete sensitive database information, causing data breaches or loss of data integrity."]

### Process 3: [Process Name]
- **Process Name:** [e.g., Slack.exe]
- **Process ID (PID):** [e.g., 7890]
- **Resource Consumption:** [e.g., RAM: 800 MB]

**Security Risk Hypothesis:**
[Example: "If Slack were compromised, an attacker could intercept internal communications, exfiltrate confidential company information, or use it as a pivot point to access other network resources."]
